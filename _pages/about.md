<p class="p-cl" style="color: #4285F4">I'm looking for a postdoc/research scientist position to round out my research portfolio. If you have any leads on these positions please let me know!</p>
<p class="p-cl">Hi there! I'm Ei Pa, a postdoctoral associate at the <a href="https://www.isri.cmu.edu/">Institute for Software Research (ISR)</a> in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, where I'm proudly mentored by <a href="https://herbsleb.org/">James Herbsleb</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="p-cl">My research interests span computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW), science and technologies studies (STS), and critical human-computer interaction (HCI), and especially how to develop, maintain, evolve, and assure the quality of a distributed software system that builds on a novel computing architecture, addressing <span style="color: #4285F4">re-usability, re-combinality, sustainability/resilience, and scalability <u>rather than usability/ease of use</u></span>.</blockquote>
<p class="p-cl">I use case study and empirical research approaches to answer sociotechnical questions which add my store of knowledge about the design, development, implementation, and quality of software systems. The methods that I use includes ethnography (interviews and non-participant observations), archival analysis, quantitative collection of log and trace data with Python, SQL, and R, and a combination of all of these methods (mixed-methods) as appropriate and relevant.</p>
<div class="p-cl">
My current investigation centers on large scale coordination in software development teams that are existing or newly formed, distributed or collocated, building software or non-software artifacts, working in an extremely compressed time scale. The coordination that I have studied to date has taken place either:
<ul>
    <li>in events known as hackathons, datathons, etc. on GitHub, where teams of programmers or designers work on developing projects that they are interested in</li>
    <li>in open-text projects where people on the Internet who may or may not be a part of the core authorship group co-produce text artifacts</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="p-cl">I received my BSc (Hons) in computer science from the University of Computer Studies in Yangon (UCSY), Myanmar, and my PhD and MSc in information systems from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore. Before Singaproe, I was a tutor at the software department at UCSY where I mainly tought data structure to freshman and sophomore, and often operating systems to juniors. Before PhD at NTU, I spent 13 months employed as an application consultant at NCS in Singapore, which is an official title that I was given, but I saw that the role as a mix of coding and customer support as I was tasked to bug-fix the accounting module of an online outpatient administration system that interfaces both with a superior trusted SAP accounting software used by the SingHealth's hospitals and with a claim module connected to the government claim system and other systems used by various insurance companies. The outpatient administration system itself was built on Microsoft .NET Framework. Before I left NCS, I develop a customer feedback tool for the system.</p>

<blockquote class="p-cl">Choosing information systems (for MSc) and information science/studies (for PhD) programs at NTU was a huge mistake of my life. I realized, as I learned more and more about the scientific computing world, these programs had swayed and clouded my believe and understanding about computing and the world in general with non-scientific quasi thoughts. I will write this in details in a blog post when I have more free time. But for now I will leave a food for thought here, <u>What is the role of "mentors" in education of any fields? What is the meaning of "openness" in scholarly communication?</u></blockquote>
