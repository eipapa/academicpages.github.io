<p style="text-align: justify">I'm a postdoctoral associate of the <a href="https://www.isri.cmu.edu/">Institute for Software Research</a> in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA, where I'm advised by <a href="https://herbsleb.org/">James Herbsleb</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><u>RESEARCH</u>. My research focuses on building a computational theory of the creation, allocation, and deployment of a network of mobile teams producing digital artifacts in a highly distributed complex uncertain environment. Central to this research effort is the socio-technical challenge of the understanding of how coordination unfolds in open world, how humans navigate and how and why make decisions in this setting. This multidisciplinary research topic overlaps the fields of computer science, psychology, applied mathematics and statistics, economics and management science, and has many applications in areas ranging from astronomy, medicine, robotics, and cyber security, to crisis management and collaborative writing.</p>

<-- Central to this research effort is the socio-technical challenge of understanding how coordination unfolds in both open and close platforms and in settings ranging from scientific, open source to commercial, from local to global, from collocated to distributed, from physical or digital,  from centralized to decentralized to hybrid, .... This multidisciplinary research topic overlaps the fields of philosophy, mathematics, computer science, software engineering, machine learning, psychology, sociology and economics, and has many applications in areas from astronomy, medicine, robotics, to open collaborative writing.-->

<!--Most of my current work focuses on large scale coordination in software development work in time-bounded events known as <a href="https://eipapa.github.io/hackathon-planning-kit/hackathons/">hackathons</a>. Specifically, I'm working on the following three projects:-->
<!--<ul style="text-align: justify"><li><b>Hackathon planning kit</b>. Together with my collaborators, I am developing a <a href="https://alexandernolte.github.io/hackathon-planning-kit/index.html">hackathon planning kit</a> that will help organizers to configure their events in a way that fits their goals and purposes.</li>-->
<!--<li><b>TrackHack</b>. This project aims to trace the spread of code from GitHub hackahton projects listed on DevPost to investigate where the code comes from and where the code lives after the hackathon.</li>-->
<!--<li><b>Open collaborative writing with GitHub</b>. This project extracts and samples a collection of open-text projects from GitHub, and zoom into the two projects to identify the best practices for writing with GitHub and then develop processes to aid open collaborative writing.</li></ul></p>-->

<p style="text-align: justify"><u>EDUCATION</u>. I obtained a PhD in information science from the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore, a MSc in information systems from the same university which is a joint program of the School of Computer Engineering and Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information, and a BSc (Honors) in computer science from the University of Computer Studies, Yangon (UCSY) in Myanmar.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><u>EXPERIENCE</u>. Before CMU, I was a research associate and part-time lecturer at the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information at NTU where I taught a number of undergraduate and graduate level courses including information visualization and managing information systems. Before PhD at NTU, I spent 13 months as an application consultant at NCS where I inspected, provided customer support, and performed monthly migration of the accounting module of a web outpatient administrative system which is implemented with Microsoft C#, .NET framework and SQL server, and developed a new customer feedback tool. Before Singapore, I spent 18 months as a tutor in the Software Department at UCSY where I taught Fundamentals of Data Structures (undergraduate level) and a few lectures on Operating Systems (undergraduate level).</p>
