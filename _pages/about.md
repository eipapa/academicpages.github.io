<p style="text-align: justify">I'm a postdoctoral associate of the <a href="https://www.isri.cmu.edu/">Institute for Software Research</a> in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA, where I'm advised by <a href="https://herbsleb.org/">James Herbsleb</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><u>RESEARCH</u>. My research focuses on building a computational foundation for the dynamic creation and deployment of mobile sub ad-hoc networks in a distributed network effectively and efficiently. This work has many applications in areas from crisis management to education to literally any areas that deal with resource allocation.</p>

<!--Central to this research effort is the socio-technical challenge of understanding how coordination unfolds in both open and close platforms and in settings ranging from scientific, open source to commercial, from local to global, from collocated to distributed, from physical or digital,  from centralized to decentralized to hybrid, .... This multidisciplinary research topic overlaps the fields of philosophy, mathematics, computer science, software engineering, machine learning, psychology, sociology and economics, and has many applications in areas from astronomy, medicine, robotics, to open collaborative writing.-->

<p style="text-align: justify"><u>RESEARCH CONTRIBUTIONS</u>. My research contributes to the computational theory of organization and coordination in development of both software/code and non-software/non-code work in a cyber-physical system.</p>

<!--Most of my current work focuses on large scale coordination in software development work in time-bounded events known as <a href="https://eipapa.github.io/hackathon-planning-kit/hackathons/">hackathons</a>. Specifically, I'm working on the following three projects:-->
<!--<ul style="text-align: justify"><li><b>Hackathon planning kit</b>. Together with my collaborators, I am developing a <a href="https://alexandernolte.github.io/hackathon-planning-kit/index.html">hackathon planning kit</a> that will help organizers to configure their events in a way that fits their goals and purposes.</li>-->
<!--<li><b>TrackHack</b>. This project aims to trace the spread of code from GitHub hackahton projects listed on DevPost to investigate where the code comes from and where the code lives after the hackathon.</li>-->
<!--<li><b>Open collaborative writing with GitHub</b>. This project extracts and samples a collection of open-text projects from GitHub, and zoom into the two projects to identify the best practices for writing with GitHub and then develop processes to aid open collaborative writing.</li></ul></p>-->

<p style="text-align: justify"><u>EDUCATION</u>. I have a PhD in information science from the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information in the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore and a MSc in information systems, a joint program of the School of Computer Engineering and Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information at NTU. I earned a BSc (Honors) in computer science from the University of Computer Studies, Yangon (UCSY) in Myanmar.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><u>EXPERIENCE</u>. Before CMU, I was a research associate and part-time lecturer at the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information at NTU where I taught a number of undergraduate and graduate level courses including information visualization and managing information systems. Before PhD at NTU, I spent 13 months as an application consultant at NCS where I inspected and provided customer support to the accounting module of a web outpatient administrative system implemented with Microsoft C#, .NET framework and SQL server. I also implemented a customer feedback tool for this system and regularly performed system migration. Before Singapore, I spent 18 months as a tutor in the Software Department at UCSY where I taught a undergraduate level course, Fundamentals of Data Structures. I also gave a few undergraduate level lectures on Operating Systems.</p>
