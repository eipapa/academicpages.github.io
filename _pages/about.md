Hello! I'm Ei Pa, a postdoctoral associate at the [Institute for Software Research (ISR)][1] in Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)â€™s School of Computer Science (SCS). My advisor is [James Herbsleb] (https://herbsleb.org/).

My research spans across the fields of Computer Science, Software Enginering, and Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW). My current research at CMU broadly covers large-group collaboration in a networked digital environment. The collaborations that I have studied to date have taken place either:
* in open-text projects where people on the Web who may or may not be a part of the core authorship group co-produce text artifacts
* in events known as hackathons, datathons, etc. on GitHub, where teams of programmers or designers work on developing projects that they are interested in

I received my PhD and MSc in Information Systems from [Nanyang Technological University (NTU)] (https://www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/home.aspx) in Singapore, and my BSc (Hons) in Computer Science from the University of Computer Studies in Yangon, Myanmar. Before doing PhD at NTU, I spent a year and two months employed as an application consultant (aka Software Developer) at NCS, Singapore where I involved in the development and maintenance of a health information system using Microsoft .NET framework.

My work has been published in academic conferences and journals including IEEE Software, ACM CSCW, CHI, Behaviour and Information Technology, Computers in Human Behavior, and Journal of the Association of Information Science and Technology (JASIST).
