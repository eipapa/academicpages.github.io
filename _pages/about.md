<p style="text-align: justify">I'm a postdoctoral associate of the <a href="https://www.isri.cmu.edu/">Institute for Software Research</a> in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, where I'm advised by <a href="https://herbsleb.org/">James Herbsleb</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><u>RESEARCH</u>. I believe in rigorous, interdisciplinary research. My research is in the field of empirical software engineering and focuses on understanding a variety of ways that developers organize and coordinate software development work in various settings including scientific, open source and commercial, with an aim to <b>building a mathematical foundation of distributed software systems that will lead to enhanced techniques for organization and coordination of distributed work efficiently and effectively</b>.

<p style="text-align: justify"><u>CONTRIBUTIONS</u>. My research contributes to the organization and coordination of the development of both software and non-software work as described below:
<ul style="text-align: justify">
    <li><b>Software</b>: under the construction.</li>
    <li><b>Non-software</b>: under the construction.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<!--<p style="text-align: justify"><u>CURRENT PROJECTS</u>. Most of my current work focuses on large scale coordination in software development work in time-bounded events known as <a href="https://eipapa.github.io/hackathon-planning-kit/hackathons/">hackathons</a>. Specifically, I'm working on the following three projects:-->
<!--<ul style="text-align: justify"><li><b>Hackathon planning kit</b>. Together with my collaborators, I am developing a <a href="https://alexandernolte.github.io/hackathon-planning-kit/index.html">hackathon planning kit</a> that will help organizers to configure their events in a way that fits their goals and purposes.</li>-->
<!--<li><b>TrackHack</b>. This project aims to trace the spread of code from GitHub hackahton projects listed on DevPost to investigate where the code comes from and where the code lives after the hackathon.</li>-->
<!--<li><b>Open collaborative writing with GitHub</b>. This project extracts and samples a collection of open-text projects from GitHub, and zoom into the two projects to identify the best practices for writing with GitHub and then develop processes to aid open collaborative writing. The paper written on this topic had been rejected many times but we commit to make some improvements and resubmit it again.</li></ul></p>-->

<p style="text-align: justify"><u>EDUCATION</u>. I received a PhD in information science from the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information in the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore and a MSc in information systems, a joint program of the School of Computer Engineering and Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information at NTU. I have a BSc (Hons) in computer science from the University of Computer Studies, Yangon (UCSY) in Myanmar.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><u>EXPERIENCE</u>. When in Myanmar, I was a tutor at the Software Department at UCSY where I mainly taught the <b>Fundamentals of Data Structures</b> course to first-year and second-year students. I also gave a few lectures on <b>Operating Systems</b> to third-year students. Before PhD at NTU, I spent 13 months as an application consultant at NCS where I audited and provided customer support to the accounting module of an online outpatient administrative system that was implemented using Microsoft C#, .NET framework and SQL server. I occasionally performed migration process and also implemented a customer feedback tool for this outpatient system.</p>
