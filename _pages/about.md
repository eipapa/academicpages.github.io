Hello there! I'm Ei Pa, a postdoctoral associate at <a href="https://www.isri.cmu.edu/">Institute for Software Research (ISR)</a> in Carnegie Mellonâ€™s School of Computer Science. My advisor is <a href="https://herbsleb.org/">James Herbsleb</a>.

My research spans across the fields of computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW), science and technology studies (STS) and human-computer interaction (HCI). My current research broadly covers large-scale coordination and collaboration in software teams that are existing or newly formed, working in an extremely compressed time scale, building software or non-software artifacts in a distributed, decentralized world. Coordination and collaboration that I have studied to date take place either:
* in open-text projects where people on the Web who may or may not be a part of the core authorship group co-produce text artifacts, and
* in events known as hackathons, datathons, etc. on GitHub, where teams of programmers or designers work on developing projects that they are interested in

I employ case study research approach to study the phenomenon of interest in context, using ethnography (interviews and participant/non-participant observation), archival analysis, quantitative collection and analysis of log and trace data with Python, SQL, and R, and a combination of all of these methods (mixed-methods). My research aims to contribute to the theory of coordination, socio-technical systems, and community of practices.

I received my PhD and MSc in Information Systems from <a href="https://www.isri.cmu.edu/">Nanyang Technological University (NTU)</a>, Singapore, and my BSc (Hons) in Computer Science from the University of Computer Studies in Yangon, Myanmar. Before doing PhD at NTU, I spent a year and two months employed as an application consultant (aka software developer) at NCS, Singapore where I involved in the development and maintenance of a health information system built with Microsoft .NET framework.

I publish my work in academic conferences and journals including IEEE Software, ACM CSCW (PACM HCI), CHI, Behaviour and Information Technology, Computers in Human Behavior, and Journal of the Association of Information Science and Technology (JASIST).
