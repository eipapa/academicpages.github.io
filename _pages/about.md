<p style="text-align: justify">I'm a postdoctoral associate of the <a href="https://www.isri.cmu.edu/">Institute for Software Research</a> in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA, where I'm advised by <a href="https://herbsleb.org/">James Herbsleb</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><u>RESEARCH</u>. My research focuses on <b>building a computational foundation for distributed software systems that will lead to enhanced techniques for organization and coordination of distributed work dynamically, efficiently and effectively</b>. Central to this research effort is the socio-technical challenge of understanding a variety of ways that developers organize and coordinate software development work <i>and</i> allocation of resources to, and integration of work done by, multiple parties across various platforms and in various settings including scientific / open source / commercial and local / global. This multidisciplinary research topic overlaps the fields of ethnography, psychology, industrial engineering and data mining, and has many applications in areas as diverse as astronomy, medicine, robotics, and open collaborative writing.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><u>RESEARCH CONTRIBUTIONS</u>. My research contributes to the theory of organization and coordination of work in both software and non-software development settings.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><u>CURRENT RESEARCH PROJECTS</u>.
<ul>
    <li><b>Hackathons</b> (Software). todo</li>
    <li><b>Open-collaborative writing</b> (Non-software). todo</li>
</ul>
</p>

<!--Most of my current work focuses on large scale coordination in software development work in time-bounded events known as <a href="https://eipapa.github.io/hackathon-planning-kit/hackathons/">hackathons</a>. Specifically, I'm working on the following three projects:-->
<!--<ul style="text-align: justify"><li><b>Hackathon planning kit</b>. Together with my collaborators, I am developing a <a href="https://alexandernolte.github.io/hackathon-planning-kit/index.html">hackathon planning kit</a> that will help organizers to configure their events in a way that fits their goals and purposes.</li>-->
<!--<li><b>TrackHack</b>. This project aims to trace the spread of code from GitHub hackahton projects listed on DevPost to investigate where the code comes from and where the code lives after the hackathon.</li>-->
<!--<li><b>Open collaborative writing with GitHub</b>. This project extracts and samples a collection of open-text projects from GitHub, and zoom into the two projects to identify the best practices for writing with GitHub and then develop processes to aid open collaborative writing.</li></ul></p>-->

<p style="text-align: justify"><u>EDUCATION</u>. I received a PhD in information science from the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information in the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore and a MSc in information systems, a joint program of the School of Computer Engineering and Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information at NTU. I have a BSc (Honors) in computer science from the University of Computer Studies, Yangon (UCSY) in Myanmar.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><u>EXPERIENCE</u>. Before CMU, I was a research associate and part-time lecturer at the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information at NTU where I taught a number of graduate and undergraduate level courses including information visualization" and managing information systems. Before PhD at NTU, I spent 13 months as an application consultant at NCS where I inspected and provided customer support to the accounting module of an online outpatient administrative system that was implemented using Microsoft C#, .NET framework and SQL server. I also implemented a customer feedback tool for this system and regularly performed the system migration. Before Singapore, I worked as a tutor at the Software Department at UCSY where I mainly taught the undergraduate level course of Fundamentals of Data Structures. I also gave a few lectures on Operating Systems to third-year students.</p>
