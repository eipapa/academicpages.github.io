Hi there! I'm Ei Pa, a postdoctoral associate at <a href="https://www.isri.cmu.edu/">Institute for Software Research (ISR)</a> in Carnegie Mellonâ€™s School of Computer Science, where I work with <a href="https://herbsleb.org/">James Herbsleb</a>.

My research interests span computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW), science and technologies studies (STS), and critical human-computer interaction (HCI), and especially how to develop distributive decentralized software systems to support productive cooperation, reinterpretability, resilience, and scalability. I use <strong>Case Study</strong> research approach to address complex socio-technical questions, which includes ethnography (interviews and non-participant observations), archival analysis, quantitative collection of log and trace data with Python, SQL, and R, and a combination of all of these methods (mixed-methods) as appropriate and relevant.

My current research broadly covers large-scale coordination in software teams that are existing or newly formed, working in an extremely compressed time scale, building software or non-software artifacts in a distributed decentralized environment. The coordination that I have studied to date has taken place either:
* in events known as hackathons, datathons, etc. on GitHub, where teams of programmers or designers work on developing projects that they are interested in
* in open-text projects where people on the Internet who may or may not be a part of the core authorship group co-produce text artifacts

I received my PhD and MSc in Information Systems from <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg">Nanyang Technological University (NTU)</a>, Singapore, and my BSc (Hons) in Computer Science from the University of Computer Studies in Yangon, Myanmar. Before doing PhD at NTU, I spent a year and two months employed as an application consultant (aka software developer) at NCS, Singapore where I involved in the development and maintenance of a health information system built with Microsoft .NET Framework.
