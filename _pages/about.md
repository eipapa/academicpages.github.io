<!-- <p style="color: #0EAC00"><strong>I'm seeking a postdoc/research scientist position to round out my research portfolio. If you have any leads let me know please!</strong></p> -->

Hi there! I'm Ei Pa, a postdoctoral associate at <a href="https://www.isri.cmu.edu/">Institute for Software Research (ISR)</a> in Carnegie Mellonâ€™s School of Computer Science, where I'm proudly mentored by <a href="https://herbsleb.org/">James Herbsleb</a>.

>My research interests span computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW), science and technologies studies (STS), and critical human-computer interaction (HCI), and especially how to develop, maintain, and evolve a decentralized distributed software system that builds on a novel and sophisticated coordination architecture that addresses <span style="color:#52854c">reinterpretability, resilience, scalability, and sustainability</span>.

I use case study research approach to address complex socio-technical questions, which includes ethnography (interviews and non-participant observations), archival analysis, quantitative collection of log and trace data with Python, SQL, and R, and a combination of all of these methods (mixed-methods) as appropriate and relevant.

>My current investigation centers on large-scale coordination in software teams that are existing or newly formed, distributed or collocated, building software or non-software artifacts, working in an extremely compressed time scale. The coordination that I have studied to date has taken place either:
* in events known as hackathons, datathons, etc. on GitHub, where teams of programmers or designers work on developing projects that they are interested in
* in open-text projects where people on the Internet who may or may not be a part of the core authorship group co-produce text artifacts

I received my BSc (Hons) in Computer Science from the University of Computer Studies in Yangon, Myanmar, and my PhD and MSc in Information Systems from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore. Before doing PhD at NTU, I spent 13 months employed as an application consultant (software developer) at NCS in Singapore where I involved in the development and maintenance of a health information system built on Microsoft .NET Framework.
