<p style="color: #b00">I'm looking for a postdoc/research scientist position to round out my research portfolio. If you have any leads on these positions please let me know!</p>
<p>Hi there! I'm Ei Pa, a postdoctoral associate at the <a href="https://www.isri.cmu.edu/">Institute for Software Research (ISR)</a> in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, where I'm proudly mentored by <a href="https://herbsleb.org/">James Herbsleb</a>.</p>
<p><u><b>RESEARCH</b></u>. I do interdisciplinary research that intersects computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW), science and technologies studies (STS) and critical human-computer interaction (HCI), and specifically investigates how to better design, develop, maintain, evolve and assure the quality of distributed software systems, addressing <span style="color: orange">reusability, recombinality, sustainability/resilience, and scalability rather than usability/ease of use.</span></p>
<p><u><b>METHODS</b></u>. I use empirical research approaches to solve complex sociotechnical problems, and the solutions and problem-solving experiences add my store of knowledge about how and why socio-technical coordination happens the distributed work. The methods that I use include ethnography (interviews and non-participant observations), case study, archival analysis, quantitative collection of log and trace data with Python, SQL, and R, and a combination of all of these methods (mixed-methods) as appropriate and relevant.</p>
<p><u><b>CURRENT PROJECTS</b></u>. My current investigation is around large scale coordination in software development teams in time-bounded events known as <a href="https://eipapa.github.io/hackathon-planning-kit/hackathons/">hackathons</a>. Depending on the hackathon design, teams may be consisting of existing or flash/new, distributed or collocated, and building software or non-software artifacts, having diverse goals and objectives, and are working in extremely compressed time scale. The two projects that I am currently working on are:
<ul>
    <li><b>TrackHack</b>. This project aims to trace the spread of code from GitHub hackahton projects listed on DevPost to investigate <span style="color: #b00">where the code comes from and where the code lives after the hackathon</span>.</li>
    <li><b>Perfection vs. customization</b>. This project extracts and samples a collection of open-text projects from GitHub, and investigates the representative candidates to identify the best practices for writing with GitHub and effective processes for <span style="color: #085">open collaborative writing</span>.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><u><b>EDUCATION</b></u>. I received a bachelor's degree in computer science from the University of Computer Studies Yangon (UCSY), Myanmar, a master's in information systems, a joint program of the School of Computer Engineering and Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information and a Ph.D. in information science from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore.</p>
<p><u><b>EXPERIENCE</b></u>. When in Myanmar, I was a tutor at the Software Department at UCSY where I mainly taught the data structures course to first-year and sophomores, and a number of classes on operating systems to juniors. Before PhD at NTU, I spent 13 months as an application consultant at NCS where I audited and provided customer support to the accounting module of an online outpatient administrative system that interfaces both with a superior trusted SAP accounting software used by SingHealth's hospitals and with the system's claim module which then interfaces with the government claim system and other systems used by several insurance companies in SingHealth's network. The outpatient administrative system itself is developed using Microsoft's .NET framework and SQL server. I also developed a customer feedback tool for the system.</p>
<p><u><b>NEW WORK</b></u>. If you're interested in <b>my new work</b>, read <a href="https://eipapa.github.io/publications" style="color: #085">my most recent papers</a>. You can also reach out to me at <a href="">eipa [at] cmu [dot] edu</a> for more questions or ask me to send my papers in PDF. I am happy to do that!</p>
<p><b><u>MORE ABOUT ME</u></b>. Personally I think I am very artistic, altruistic, bold, calm, cooperative, flexible, outgoing, and the list goes on. I like being in mixed-reality and perfecting things for which I received many wonderful compliments from fantastic people that I had met in the past 12 years, often in games. <spam style="color: #b00">Stay tuned for more on my story!</spam></p>
