<p>I'm a postdoctoral associate of the <a href="https://www.isri.cmu.edu/">Institute for Software Research (ISR)</a> in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, where I'm proudly mentored by <a href="https://herbsleb.org/">James Herbsleb</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><u>RESEARCH</u>. I believe in rigorous, interdisciplinary research. My research is in the field of empirical software engineering with a focus on <b>various ways that developers organize software development work</b> in various settings including scientific, open source, and commercial, adopting research techniques from fields including anthropology, psychology, industrial engineering, and data mining. My research aims to <b>improve productivity and software quality</b>.

<p><u>CONTRIBUTIONS</u>. todo.</p>

<p><u>ONGOING WORK</u>. My current investigation is around large scale coordination in software development teams in time-bounded events known as <a href="https://eipapa.github.io/hackathon-planning-kit/hackathons/">hackathons</a>. Depending on the hackathon design, teams may be consisting of existing or flash/new, distributed or collocated, and building software or non-software artifacts, having diverse goals and objectives, and are working in extremely compressed time scale. Here're my current projects:
<ul><li><b>Hackathon planning kit</b>. Together with my collaborators, I am constructing a <a href="https://alexandernolte.github.io/hackathon-planning-kit/index.html">hackathon planning kit</a> that will help organizers to configure their events that fit their goals and purposes.</li>
<li><b>TrackHack</b>. This project aims to trace the spread of code from GitHub hackahton projects listed on DevPost to investigate where the code comes from and where the code lives after the hackathon.</li>
<li><b>Perfection vs. customization</b>. This project extracts and samples a collection of open-text projects from GitHub, and zoom into the two projects to identify the best practices for writing with GitHub and then develop processes to aid open collaborative writing.</li></ul></p>

<p><u>EDUCATION</u>. I received a MSc in information systems which is a joint program of the School of Computer Engineering and Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information, and a PhD in information science from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore. I has a BSc (Hons) in computer science from the University of Computer Studies, Yangon (UCSY) in Myanmar.</p>

<p><u>EXPERIENCE</u>. When in Myanmar, I was a tutor at the Software Department at UCSY where I mainly taught the <b>Foundation of Data Structures</b> course to first-year and sophomores. I also gave a number of lectures on <b>Operating Systems</b> to juniors. Before PhD at NTU, I spent 13 months as an application consultant at NCS where I audited and provided customer support to the accounting module of an online outpatient administrative system that interfaces both with a superior trusted SAP accounting software used by SingHealth's hospitals and with the system's claim module which then interfaces with the government claim system and other systems used by several insurance companies in SingHealth's network. The outpatient administrative system itself is developed using Microsoft's .NET framework and SQL server. I also developed a customer feedback tool for the system.</p>
<p><u>NEW WORK</u>. If you're interested in <b>my new work</b>, read <a href="https://eipapa.github.io/publications" style="color: #085">my most recent papers</a>. You can also reach out to me at <a href="">eipa [at] cmu [dot] edu</a> for more questions or ask me to send my papers in PDF. I am happy to do that!</p>
