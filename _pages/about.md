<p style="text-align: justify">I'm a postdoctoral associate of the <a href="https://www.isri.cmu.edu/">Institute for Software Research (ISR)</a> in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, where I'm advised by <a href="https://herbsleb.org/">James Herbsleb</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><u>RESEARCH</u>. I believe in rigorous, interdisciplinary research. My research is in the field of <b>empirical software engineering</b> and focuses on understanding a variety of ways that developers organize and coordinate software development work in various settings including scientific, open source, and commercial, adopting research techniques from fields including anthropology, psychology, industrial engineering, and data mining, with an aim to <b>improve productivity and software quality</b>.

<p style="text-align: justify"><u>CONTRIBUTIONS</u>. under the construction.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><u>CURRENT PROJECTS</u>. Most of my current work focuses on large scale coordination in software development work in time-bounded events known as <a href="https://eipapa.github.io/hackathon-planning-kit/hackathons/">hackathons</a>. I'm particularly working on the following three projects:
<ul style="text-align: justify"><li><b>Hackathon planning kit</b>. Together with my collaborators, I am developing a <a href="https://alexandernolte.github.io/hackathon-planning-kit/index.html">hackathon planning kit</a> that will help organizers to configure their events in a way that fits their goals and purposes.</li>
<li><b>TrackHack</b>. This project aims to trace the spread of code from GitHub hackahton projects listed on DevPost to investigate where the code comes from and where the code lives after the hackathon.</li>
<li><b>Perfection vs. customization</b>. This project extracts and samples a collection of open-text projects from GitHub, and zoom into the two projects to identify the best practices for writing with GitHub and then develop processes to aid open collaborative writing. The paper written on this topic had been rejected many times but we commit to make some improvements and resubmit it again.</li></ul></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><u>EDUCATION</u>. I has a PhD in information science from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore and a MSc in information systems which is a joint program of the School of Computer Engineering and Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information, and a BSc (Hons) in computer science from the University of Computer Studies, Yangon (UCSY) in Myanmar.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><u>EXPERIENCE</u>. When in Myanmar, I was a tutor at the Software Department at UCSY where I mainly taught the <b>Foundation of Data Structures</b> course to first-year and sophomores. During my time at UCSY, I also gave a few lectures on <b>Operating Systems</b> to juniors. Before PhD at NTU, I spent 13 months as an application consultant at NCS where I audited and provided customer support to the accounting module of an online outpatient administrative system that interfaces both with a superior trusted SAP accounting software used by SingHealth's hospitals and with the system's claim module which then interfaces with the government claim system and other systems used by several insurance companies in SingHealth's network. The outpatient administrative system itself is developed using Microsoft's .NET framework and SQL server. I also implemented and integrated a customer feedback tool with the system.</p>
